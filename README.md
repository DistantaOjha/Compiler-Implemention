- Variable Storage for integers.

- All basic arithmatic operations

- Printing integers.

- Get integer input.

- If-else statement (expression ==0?).

- While loop (while expression!=0) and for-loop.

- Integer Lists.

- Functions.

- Python like Generators.

- Classes (with public static properties and methods).

- Switch between pass by reference and pass by value-result.

**Setup for bash shell**

Run the script file compile.sh.

Write a minipython program in a .mipy file.

Run the command "cat <programname.mipy> | Debug/calc".
